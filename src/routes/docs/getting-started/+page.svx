# Getting Started

Everything starts with signing up. Once you're registered, you'll have access to rounds, scoring, the tag leaderboard, and the web dashboard.

---

## Signing up

Frolf Bot uses a **reaction-based signup flow** to keep things casual. Look for the signup message in the designated signup channel — it's pinned or posted by an admin when the bot is configured.

1. **React** to the signup message with the 🥏 emoji
2. **Check your DMs** — Frolf Bot will send you a message with a "Sign Up" button
3. **Click the button** to open the signup form

> **No DMs?** Make sure you have DMs enabled from server members. Discord settings → Privacy & Safety → Allow direct messages from server members.

### The signup form

The form has three optional fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Tag Number** | Your desired starting tag number (1–100). First-come, first-served — if it's taken you'll be assigned the next available. |
| **UDisc Username** | Your `@username` on UDisc (e.g. `@janedoe`). Used for automatic scorecard matching. |
| **UDisc Display Name** | Your name as it appears on UDisc scorecards. Used when your username isn't on the scorecard. |

All fields are optional. You can update them later with [`/set-udisc-name`](/docs/admin#set-udisc-name).

## After signup

Once your signup is processed, you'll receive the **Player role** and can:

- Create and RSVP to rounds with `/createround`
- Claim or challenge tags with `/claimtag`
- Submit scores during active rounds
- View your history with `/history`

---

## Joining via invite

If an editor sends you an invite code, you can join their club directly — no reaction-based signup needed.

1. Go to the Frolf Bot PWA and navigate to the join page
2. Enter the invite code
3. The preview shows the club name and what role you'll receive
4. Confirm to complete membership

Invite codes are created by editors from the [account page](/docs/account#managing-invite-codes).

---

## Accessing the dashboard

Use the `/dashboard` command in any channel to get a link to the web app. The dashboard shows:

- Live leaderboard standings
- Recent and upcoming rounds
- Tag history and season stats

You can also bookmark the dashboard URL directly. Sign in with Discord to link your account.

The [account page](/docs/account) (`/account`) is where you manage linked sign-in providers and, for editors, create invite codes for your club. If you don't have a club membership yet, the dashboard will show clubs on your Discord servers that use Frolf Bot — you can join directly from there.
