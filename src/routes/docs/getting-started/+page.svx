# Getting Started

Everything starts with signing up. Once you're registered, you'll have access to rounds, scoring, the tag leaderboard, and the web dashboard.

---

## Signing up

Frolf Bot uses a **reaction-based signup flow** to keep things casual. Look for the signup message in the designated signup channel — it's pinned or posted by an admin when the bot is configured.

1. **React** to the signup message with the 🥏 emoji
2. **Check your DMs** — Frolf Bot will send you a message with a "Sign Up" button
3. **Click the button** to open the signup form

> **No DMs?** Make sure you have DMs enabled from server members. Discord settings → Privacy & Safety → Allow direct messages from server members.

### The signup form

The form has three optional fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Tag Number** | Your desired starting tag number (1–100). First-come, first-served — if it's taken you'll be assigned the next available. |
| **UDisc Username** | Your `@username` on UDisc (e.g. `@janedoe`). Used for automatic scorecard matching. |
| **UDisc Display Name** | Your name as it appears on UDisc scorecards. Used when your username isn't on the scorecard. |

All fields are optional. You can update them later with [`/set-udisc-name`](/docs/admin#set-udisc-name).

## After signup

Once your signup is processed, you'll receive the **Player role** and can:

- Create and RSVP to rounds with `/createround`
- Claim or challenge tags with `/claimtag`
- Submit scores during active rounds
- View your history with `/history`

---

## Accessing the dashboard

Use the `/dashboard` command in any channel to get a link to the web app. The dashboard shows:

- Live leaderboard standings
- Recent and upcoming rounds
- Tag history and season stats

You can also bookmark the dashboard URL directly. Sign in with Discord to link your account.
